passopts - extended PASS options for irc2.11.2p3

######################################################################

an attempt to solve the problem with clients connecting with a
password, expecting it to match an I-line, but matching another non-
passworded I-line (possibly revealing their real address if spoofed)

this current proposal (passopts v1) is far from perfect and it still
needs some adjusting, it might change entirely. it does not work with
: prefixed passwords (passwords which may or may not have a space)

i does however work quite well for many clients and is not breaking
anything for the rest (passopts just doesnt work for them)

PASSOPTS is enabled by default

######################################################################

current proposal (as implemented in passopts v1):

 PASS <password> [<passopts>]

  ignore remaining arguments if any

  <password>
   password as per RFC

  <passopts>
   integer (in base 10 only) bitfield of password options

  fail gracefully if <passopts> is not numeric (as if 0)

  ignore unknown bits if any

  allow prepended 0s

  0x01 POFLAG_REQPASS
    require I-line password match client password and do not allow
    matching empty I-line password

  examples:

   PASS mustmatch 1
   PASS dontcare 0
   PASS mustmatch 007
   PASS dontcare 42
   PASS mustmatch 1 any thing

 thank you to the following people for helping with the first draft
 of the passopts specification: BR and patrick

 ircII/EPIC                                       [almost compatible]
